## Problem 1

Import data

``` r
pols_df = 
  read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month","day"), sep=c(4,7)) |>
  mutate (
    month = 
    case_match(
      month, 
      "-01" ~ "January",
      "-02" ~ "Febuary",
      "-03" ~ "March",
      "-04" ~ "April", 
      "-05" ~ "May",
      "-06" ~ "June",

  mutate (
    president =

    2 ~ "gop"
    )
  ) |>
  subset(select = -c(day, prez_dem, prez_gop))

Clean data in snp.csv

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("./data/snp.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") |> # drop day
  subset(select = -day) |>
  mutate (
    month = 
    case_match(
      month, 
      "1" ~ "January",

snp_df$year = ifelse(as.numeric(snp_df$year)>= 50, paste0("19",snp_df$year), paste0("20", snp_df$year))
# switch the order between year and month 
snp_df = snp_df[, c("year", "month", "close")]
```

Tidy up unemployment data

``` r
unemp_df = 
  read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> # switching from wide to long 
  pivot_longer(jan:dec,
               names_to = "month",
               values_to = "unemployment rate") |>
  mutate (
    year = as.character(year),
    month = 
    case_match(
      month, 
      "jan" ~ "January",
      "feb" ~ "Febuary",

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into results

Left-join snp into pols, then add unemployment data as well

``` r
snp_pols_data = 
  left_join(pols_df, snp_df, by = c("year", "month"))

merged_data = left_join(snp_pols_data, unemp_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The merged data has 822 rows and 11 columns. It contains three datasets.
The first one is called pols_df, it contains 822 rows and 9 columns
data, ranging from 1947 to 2015. The data is about number of
republican/democratic governors/senators on associated date and whether
the president is from republican or democratic. The second one is called
snp_df, it contains 787 rows and 3 columns data, ranging from 1950 to
2015. It described closing values of the stock index on the associated
date. The third dataset is called unemp_df, it contains 816 rows and 3
columns data, ranging from 1948 to 2015. It described the percentage of
unemployment in given month-year.

## Problem 2

``` r
library(readxl) # read Mr. Trash Wheel data
MtrashW_df = 
  read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N586") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    homes_powered = (
      weight_tons*500/30
    )
  )

MtrashW_df$Name = "Mr. Trash Wheel"
```

``` r
PtrashW_df = 
  read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M108") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
    mutate(
    year = as.character(year),
    homes_powered = (
      weight_tons*500/30
    )
  )
PtrashW_df$Name = "Professor Trash Wheel"


Gwynnda_df = 
  read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range = "A2:L157") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
    mutate(
    year = as.character(year),
    homes_powered = (
      weight_tons*500/30
    )
  )
Gwynnda_df$Name = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel"
```

Combine these two dataset with Mr. Trash Wheel.

``` r
trash_tidy = 
  bind_rows (MtrashW_df, PtrashW_df, Gwynnda_df) |>
  janitor::clean_names() 
# move trash wheel name to the first column 
trash_tidy = trash_tidy[, c("name", setdiff(names(trash_tidy), "name"))]
```

There are three datasets in this problem. The first one is called
Mr. Trash Wheel, it has 15 variables and it includes data of 584
dumpsters, ranging from 2014 to 2023. The second one is called Professor
Trash Wheel, it has 14 variables and it includes data of 106 dumpsters,
ranging from 2017 to 2023. Similarly, the third one is called Gwynnda
Trash Wheel, it has 13 variables and it includes data of 155 dumpsters,
ranging from 2021 to 2023. Some of their collected trash are
plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 216.26
tons. The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July
of 2021 is 1.63^{4}.

## Problem 3

Import, clean, and tidy baseline demographic database

``` r
baseline_df = 
  read_csv("./data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> # convert sex/apoe4 from number to name 
mutate ( 
    sex = case_match(
      sex,
      1 ~ "male", 
      0 ~ "female"
    ),
    apoe4 = case_match(
      apoe4,
      1 ~ "APOE4 carrier",
      0 ~ "APOE4 non-carrier"
    )
  )  # remove participants without MCI value
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
c_baseline_df = filter(baseline_df, age_at_onset != ".")
```

Description: To import the baseline dataset, read_csv function is used
and skip = 1 is used to skip the explanation line above header. Mutate
function is then used to change sex values to male or female and apoe4
values to carrier or non-carrier. Finally, the filter function is used
to filter out those who do not have MCI values recorded.

The total number of participants is 483. Among those, 97 developed MCI.
The average baseline age of those 97 patients is 70.26. In this study,
30 female patients are apoe4 carrier, which counts for 30.93% proportion
of total patients.

Import, clean and tidy longitudinally dataset

``` r
amyloid_df = 
  read_csv("./data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  rename(id = study_id) # change study_id to id to match column names to baseline_df
```

    ## Rows: 487 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (5): Baseline, Time 2, Time 4, Time 6, Time 8
    ## dbl (1): Study ID
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Read_csv is also used to import dataset of longitudinally observed
biomarker values. To help the comparison between two datasets easier,
the column name study_id is changed to id using rename(). In this
longitudinal study, there are total 487 participants being traced.

``` r
amyloid_df = 
  pivot_longer(
    amyloid_df, 
    baseline:time_8, 
    names_to = "time",
    values_to = "time_elapse"
  )
```

Pivot longer is then used to make the data looks more tidy. The Amyloid
dataset contains time (in years) elapsed since the study baseline to the
visit where biomarker Amyloid: 42/40 ratio was measured. There are total
487 patients being measured.

``` r
same_id_baseline = sum(baseline_df$id %in% amyloid_df$id) # check the number of id in baseline apper in amyloid
same_id_c_baseline = sum(c_baseline_df$id %in% amyloid_df$id)
```

In amyloid and baseline datasets, 475 appeared in both, some of them are
healthy while 94 of them developed MCI later.

Combine two dataset so who appear in both datasets are retained

``` r
m_amybase = merge(c_baseline_df, amyloid_df, by = "id")
```

Values from two datasets of those 94 patients are combined. 220 of them
are female and 250 of them are male. 155 males are APOE4 carriers and
145 females are APOE4 carriers.

Export combined dataset as CSV to the data_mci directory

``` r
write_csv(m_amybase, "data_mci/m_amybase.csv")
```
